# 🎯 Bubble Pop Game

An interactive browser-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game was created as a learning project to strengthen DOM manipulation, timer logic, and event-driven JavaScript programming.

## 🕹️ How to Play
- A target number is displayed at the top.
- Click (pop) the bubble with the **matching number** to earn points.
- A 60-second countdown timer is running — score as much as you can before time runs out!
- Incorrect bubbles are ignored; only matching numbers count.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- JavaScript DOM manipulation: `createElement`, `appendChild`, `setInterval`, `event listeners`, etc.
- Dynamic content generation and removal using loops and timers.
- Basic game mechanics: scoring system, user feedback, countdown timer.
- Styling and layout using CSS Flexbox.
